# CSGO-Tickless-Movement
Trying to achieve analytically integrated movement in CSGO


# On building:
To build, you are going to need: 
the metamod:source source for [1.12 - build 1219](https://github.com/alliedmodders/metamod-source/tree/02ee4a312525d17b2f6d2f21a953d06) and [hl2sdk/csgo](https://github.com/alliedmodders/hl2sdk/tree/csgo). If you are on Linux or using anything else than MSVC to compile, you are on your own, but PRs welcome.
